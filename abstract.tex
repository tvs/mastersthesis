In recent years, cloud computing has been used to support a plethora of
applications ranging from simple websites to giant, data- and compute-driven
services. Previously we have developed a caching system designed to utilize the
elasticity of the cloud in an automated cost-aware approach. In this paper we
continue exploration of this elastic \emph{key-value} cache as a means for
accelerating both data- and compute-intensive applications. We present a
hybridized cloud caching system that utilizes in-instance memory, in-instance
disk, and a persistent storage medium. Further, we create a hierarchy from
these mediums to reflect the importance of the data within, and provide
mechanisms for placing this data within the hierarchy. Finally, we evaluate a
number of data eviction and data placement schemes and their impact on the
speed performance of our cache.
